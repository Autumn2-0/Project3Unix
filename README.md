# Project3Unix

#The following program is a Character Creator created using Python.
#When the user first opens the program, text is printed with different options for the user to choose. #They are as follows:

#1.	Create a character
#2.	Modify a character
#3.	Delete a character
#4.	List characters 
#5.	Exit

#The user then selects the number for the option they would like to choose. If they choose to create a #character, the program asks for their characters name. Upon the name being #chosen, the program then #copies a pre-written file that contains a character creation structure. This copied file is then named #the name of the new character and added to a #character creator folder.

#If the user chooses to edit a character they are asked to enter the characters name. If the name is a 
#valid file, each line is called indiviually. For a particular line, the user is asked how they would #like to edit the line. 

#If the user decides they would like to delete a character, they are once again asked what the #characterâ€™s name is. Like modify if the character is not found the program prints a #message saying so. #If the character is found, the program asks the user if they are sure they would like to delate. If the #user types in Y, the file containing the character is #deleted. 

#When the user selects lists characters, the program will list all the character files in the directory.
